#Autotrasporti Rotari 

This site was requested from a company which I was working for before starting Makers Academy. The company is based in Ravenna (IT), it is a haulage company which mainly transports goods by road. 
Autotrasporti Rotari collaborates with the biggest matalurgical company in Italy called Marcegaglia Srl. and also collaborates with CONTAINEX - the specialist for containers and mobile space solutions.
The company asked me to build the site because I frequently stood in for the CEO while I worked for them which has allowed me  to develop the website with the detailed experience I gained, giving the company the best image I could.

#Technologies 

For developing this web site I wanted to use technologies that I had never used before. I decided to use Node.js for the back-end and jade for the front end, and I also used the google geolocation API to find the position of the user and give travel directions to the company. I also automated the process of sending emails directly to the CEO of the company in the "Contatti" page.
