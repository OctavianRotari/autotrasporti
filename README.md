#Autotrasporti Rotari 

This site was requested from a company which I was working before starting the course. The company is based in Ravenna (IT), it is a haulage company which mainly transports goods by road. 
Autotrasporti Rotari collaborates with the biggest matalurgical company in Italy Marcegaglia Srl. and also collaborates with CONTAINEX - the specialist for containers and mobile space solutions.
The company asked me to build the site because when I worked with them I frequently subsitute the CEO, so I knew how the company works by doing so I was able to describe it as better as possible, to give to the company the best image I could.

#Technologies 

For developing this web site I wanted to use technologies that I've never used before, so I decided to use Node.js for the back-end and jade for the front end, I also used the google geolocation API to find the position of the user and give indications on how to go to the company. I also automized the process of sending emails directly to the CEO of the company in the "Contatti" page.
